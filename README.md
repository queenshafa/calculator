# Calculator!

Thanks to https://www.codingnepalweb.com/ for the code resources. I really don't know what to do, because I have website challenge using elementor, but it is really boring for me, so i remake this calculator for my Math Exam, incase the chrome console broke? :D. Changed the UI and add a footer. I'm trying to understand the codes, mainly the javascript.
